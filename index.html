        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <ol>            
            <li>Blockchain E-Voting System</li>
            <p>
                I led a cross-functional team to develop an innovative blockchain-based E-Voting system using Solidity smart contracts. This project involved the
                implementation of robust cryptographic techniques and the optimization of the system architecture for scalability. This project highlights my expertise
                in blockchain technology and distributed systems, which are valuable skills for roles related to security and data integrity.
            </p>

            <li>Grayscale Image Colorization</li>
            <p>
                The project focused on creating a robust grayscale image colorization system using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural
                Networks (CNNs) implemented in Python with TensorFlow. This project showcases my ability to work with advanced neural networks, image
                processing, and computer vision, demonstrating my skills in solving complex image-related challenges.
